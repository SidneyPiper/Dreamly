        <LabeledText label="Why Keep a Dream Diary?">
          <p>A dream diary is more than just a journal for dreams - itâ€™s a tool for self-discovery. Here are some of the
            benefits:</p>
          <LabeledText label="Enhanced Dream Recall" small>

          <LabeledText label="Lucid Dreaming" small>
            <p>A dream diary can aid in recognizing patterns in your dreams, making it easier to identify when you are
              dreaming and eventually take control of the dream.</p>
          </LabeledText>
          <LabeledText label="Self-Reflection" small>
            <p>Dreams often reveal hidden thoughts and emotions. Recording them can lead to a deeper understanding of
              your subconscious.</p>

        <LabeledText label="Meet the Developers">
          <p>Dreamly was created by <span class="font-bold">Sidney Piper</span> and <span
              class="font-bold">John Wagner</span>,
            a development duo with a shared fascination for dreams. Both
            Sidney and John collaborated closely on every aspect of the app, from its design to how it works behind the
            scenes. The idea for Dreamly came about when they began sharing their own vivid and interesting dreams,
            realizing the value of having a dedicated space to record and reflect on them.</p>
          <p>Together, they believe that <span class="font-bold">the better we understand our dreams, the better we understand ourselves</span>,
            and Dreamly was built with this philosophy in mind.</p>
